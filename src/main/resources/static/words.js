Much like the entirety of the album, The Year of the Hibernation, Trevor Powers is portraying his mental battles, and has described his work on the album to be a part of who he is and the things that haunt him. The snakes continually represent something he should not seek, while he is dependent on God for salvation from his innate temperaments.He is seeking someone to turn to that will not accommodate his mental restraint and solitude.His brain is flooded with thoughts, but the thoughts do not perish as immediately as they arise.This relates to the original verses of innocence, and untainted joy during his youth.In adulthood, he is still conveying his imagination and the ability to steer his own thoughts.What is the most powerful line of the song, and undoubtedly the album, Trevor Powers embodies a contradictory sense of dismay and hopefulness at the advice that has come to shape his remorse in growing old, however, his mothers uplifting presence can still mentally cradle him.Drifting back to consciousness, he is disconnecting from the imagery of his past.Isolated in his own thoughts, he has reverted to his memories.Again, this line exudes a young spirit but the snake is a metaphor for a greater evil that is being sought out, an abandonment of innocence.The opening line is symbolic of a youthful time, the camp and the lake representing the euphoria that summer breeds.His despondency is likely a result of heartbreak and missing someone. He can’t help but waste the days away.AnxietyIt seems like he made a decision that created the situation he is now in with a (past) lover, and he is starting to question that decision or regret itHe’s anxious, most likely because he’s worried about the decision that he made mentioned in the verse prior. He’s overthinking his decisions and he’s questioning himself, his demons weighing what he should and shouldn’t have doneWhen they’re speaking they get muddled with their words and maybe are afraid to say what they really mean. But singing provides a more open platform for them to express themselves and it’s a way for them to really express how they feel.Youth Lagoon is portraying this sense of despondency and emotionless. A feeling of being distracted or out of place. We get this image of someone sitting inside a dark room all day watching TV without really seeing the images, this gives off a sense of depression or emptiness.Trevor is SHOUTING out the obvious truth of our society. that is that we our so PREDICTABLE. our cycles are always the same. and its kind of depressing to think someone can describe the majority of america’s society with only a few lines. We follow our routines, we play our role in society, we fall in love, our hearts get broken, maybe we lose our jobs. We only love things that we cant keep forever…. but at the same time….what can we keep forever?refer to first bridgeTrevor qualifies by saying america is a gifted country with many qualities that are much more satisfying, safe, and moral in contrast with other countries; But the the list is out-weighed by peoples pain and struggle. with a play of words he gives one example of our pain and struggle as americans.we show an effort towards religion, but why? is it because it is the only thing that keeps us going? or is it just part of a routine?refer to first bridgea smack towards consumerism. a lazy america buying things instead of doing things.still part of routine. parallel to the first verseWe as humans always pray for things that we feel are temporary, such as rain. rain doesnt last forever and it is something that we need. But at the same time we never pray for the sun because it is something that has always been there. We take for granted the things that we expect to come to us. instead of focusing all of the things that our wrong in our lives maybe we should focus on all of the things that are right.A powerful statement. Praying for health or the relief of pain is useless because pain will always be here on earth with everyone. A pray for change, either with lifestyle or ideology would be better so that we as humans can actually cope with the pain.The theme of the song: REPETITION, ROUTINE, NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS. and that is the depressing sermon Trevor Powers is trying to vocalize through this song.half asleep, uniform coated with dirt. apathy, and lack of motivation which is caused by the idea that we as human beings aren’t worth something unless we make a “difference” in the world.routine, daily life, nobody special. a clerk at a gas station. this description (weather it an exact description or just a generalization of a person with a normal job) describes most of the people in America, a majority being its youth.Hinting he was responsible for that in some way, or lying.http://genius.com/8033850 This time though, it’s already too late.The speaker is the doctor actually, he says to his patients they can trust him. But he’s getting in their head that they’ll die, and to depress them even more he laughs when they declare: “I won’t die easily”In fact, the more effort one puts into convincing him not to, the more set he will become on pursuing this dream and leaving.He is set on following his dreams and no one can tell him differently.He’s saying: “Get ready! I’m going to war with anyone that stands in the way of my resolve; and you’ll have to do a whole lot more than talk me down if you want me to quit.” (The rest of the lyrics in this section simply go on to reiterate how determined he his to accomplish his goal – a truly enviable sense of certainty.)Though he’ll eventually recover, the emotional wound he carries will stick with him for a long time. The second line states that she wasn’t careful with what she said, and doesn’t know how much she hurt him.He’s saying that whatever he’s talking about, most likely a girl, hurt him and he wants to say something about it, and it’s taking a lot of effort not to. It could be that he wants to say whats on his mind, or perhaps to say something hurtful back. The next line means that even though it’s not a physical wound, he was still emotionally hurt.It’s not clear what the narrator feels so strongly about, but it has something to do with following up his dreams. The reference to a car could imply that following his dreams require him to leave home.This line relates back to the one earlier about the headache. Now, it seems clearer that the headache is caused by overthinking and anxiety, as often anxiety is personified as being a monster/demon which is a personification of insecurities. This seems fit as the verse prior is all about feeling insecure about his feelings for the person he is daydreaming about. Again, I am reminded of a lyric from another song, this time twenty one pilots' song Migraine: “We should take a day to break away from all the pain our brain has made”.What may be contributing to his headache is heart ache and the overwhelming impossibility of being with the person he is thinking about. Overall, his fantasies surrounding being with this person are positive and a contrast to the headache he has. The second line relays a feeling that he shouldn’t be thinking about this person: maybe he/she has a significant other, etc. He needs to be careful about daydreaming only when he is alone and free from judgment from others. These lyrics kind of remind me of the lyric “I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs, but I’m afraid that someone else will hear me” from the Fall Out Boy song The Shipped Gold Standard because of the themes of how anxiety affects your thoughts about someone. Sometimes someone can really love/like/enjoy someone and want a romantic relationship, but once their relationship is public and subject to judgement from others, anxiety can cause one to overthink the relationship. This makes it difficult for someone to know what he/she really wants and causes them to avoid sharing personal romantic relations with people as they do not want this added element of judgement from others. So here, the narrator prefers to keep his daydreaming about this person to himself. Overall, I am talking about feeling insecure (and fearing judgement).He’s trying to dispel his headache, but can’t quite place what is causing it. Thus, he took a walk to get some fresh air and distance himself from any stress that may be what is causing it; however, this method has not remedied his headache.At this point, the person on the deathbed has most likely passed, and Trevor is reiterating the fact that he or she will never truly, as in spiritually, die.Although the person is physically dying, spiritually, he or she will live forever.The increasing intensity in the music between the chorus and this bridge represents the beloved person passing away. This bridge, in stark contrast to the phrase “you will never die,” represents the emotions of Trevor as he watches his beloved die.When we die, the state sometimes “seizes” some of our assets, through the estate tax. Perhaps this is what this line refers to. Regardless of that, the fact that we’re talking about an ‘angel’ here shows that death is on the horizon.This is giving us the setting of the story: a hospital room. An “eternal cave”, because the person that the narrator is visiting will die here. “One made of drapes” refers to the curtains in the hospital room.the water symbolizes a kind of emotional drowning. Since he was young reality was crushing and life at home was a lot to deal withI interpret this line to mean some relative brought bad news that “shook” his family which lead to the silence in his homeWhen he was young some problem shook up his family and deeply effected him. This could possibly be his uncles drug abuse, which the song “Kerry” is about.Powers had to grow up quickly due to some instance in his home that upset his psycheTrevor sleeps with his phone, perhaps because he has trouble sleeping and uses it to help him fall asleep by playing music or reading or writing on it, or he waits for messages throughout the night from a lover or friends that might be painful (wants to be there for him). Or his phone holds things on it that he is emotionally attached to and wants to keep close to himThis line is similar to that in DaydreamThe ghost sees/knows the pain Trevor feels. Self harm? Or trying to figure out what he’s really made of as he experiences painThe ghost that sees everything Trevor goes through when he’s alone, the one that is around in the comfort of his home and bedroomIn the Fader interview, Powers described the feeling of losing his close friend: Anyone who’s experienced any sort of loss, you know you go out on a windy day you feel the wind on your skin and you feel like they’re still there.A large riot usually has officers trying to stop the people with stun guns, and the riot is a mess of smoke and sirens.Based on the Fader interview, this line likely has the overt meaning of Police’s aggressive response toward peaceful protesters and Black Lives Matter activists. In the wake of many police shootings of unarmed black men throughout the mid-2010s many protests of the police’s use of lethal force were met by a militarized police force seemingly eager to start a riot. Emblematic of such events would be the unrest in Ferguson Missouri, pictured below:Police fail to empathize with protesters, instead standing by their own regardless of the overwhelming, evidence of wrongdoing. It’s as if a chip implanted in their brain is controlling their actions. As many peaceful protests have erupted in violence and chaos, police wind up doubling down on their violence and mocking those on the ground. The pin likely refers to the badge and being physically pinned to the ground, likely without sufficient reason.This song is intensely personal to Trevor Powers and rather revealing; he kind of goes all out here with the ah-ahs in an emotional climax best described when looking at fireworks.Hope still remains; perhaps our narrator finds refuge in a better relationship.The bridge between the two people (their relationship) had slowly been built but was then burned away with the song he sang ending itThe same guitar he refereed to before, singing a song to the other person while breaking upIn a literal sense, most likely ‘letting go’ of the other person in this relationship the song refers tooThe narrator is experiencing an intense emotional struggle; ironically he watches the ‘bombs’ go off from a point of safely while inside his soul bare and unprotected to due whatever he is experiencing (not safe at all)A lot of Youth Lagoon’s music is about small meaningful memories which have played a large part (emotionally) in Trevor Power’s life, simple things like watching fireworks explode from a rooftop.The narrator (probably Trevor Powers) likens his neighbors fireworks to bombs going off (in a poetic and meaningful manner which is standard of most of the music Youth Lagoon releases)At this point we get a slightly better concept of what the narrator is dealing with; the passion of a relationship lost.The narrator seems to be having some sort of emotional crisis (most likely love related, as the next line suggests). Whatever it was, it must of been a rather internal struggle (one of several which permeate this record)Sounds like reckless teen years and simpler timesThe memory being referenced in this song takes place on the 4th of July, hence the song title and watching the fireworksThis should say casino gold.Noise in his ears.An allusion to the biblical account of Lot’s wife, who allegedly was turned into a pillar of salt after she looked back at the city of Sodom. The wife and her family were told to leave Sodom, their hometown, by angels. Here, the narrator compares himself to Lot’s wife in that he was told to leave his significant other’s life just as the wife was told to leave her home town. Still possessing feelings for this person, the narrator couldn’t (or can’t) get over her completely and thus fell victim to the torments of retrospecting his time with her. The “hat” is Trevor Powers signature flat-hat.An allusion to “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame” by Victor Hugo, in which Quasimodo (“the village scapegoat”) is in love with a beautiful woman, though a relationship between them is impossible. Due to his deformity, Quasimodo is not respected by most of his fellow citizens and thus is only able to express himself by ringing Notre Dame’s bells.The narrator promised himself that he wouldn’t let himself be hurt by the loss, a vow that seems to be easier in theory for him.In accordance with the second interpretation of the previous line, the narrator resolves to get over his loss.This line is possibly referring to two aspects of loss simultaneously. One of these is that if a relationship (“plant”) isn’t constantly getting better (“grow"ing), there isn’t a good chance it will survive. The line could also be referring to the narrator himself, who recognizes that he is for all intents and purposes dead if he can’t "grow” and move beyond his lost.A person’s unrequited feelings left over from an ended relationship can cause suffering for that person if he/she doesn’t fully accept the finality of the loss.This opening verse contains the event of loss around which the rest of the song is centered: although the music video implies that this is the death of a loved one at war, the song itself seems to suggest it is being broken up with in a relationship. Assuming the latter theory is correct, the narrator is recalling the night his significant other broke up with him. “The Monsters in the room were all dancing to the music all around us” is symbolic of an argument in the airHe is trying to find heaven and is having a spiritual journey.He will hide his soul in a graveyard as long as he can.The devil tempt his soul but he won’t give in.He might have anthropomorphized time into a god-like figure or even God himself. Later on in the song it seems as though he is deadEmotions are rather uncontrollable and unpredictable. You can feel sad even though nothing particularly bad has happened, or you can be happy when you have heard solemn news. Emotions are difficult to understand and even more difficult to control.He secretly has suicidal thoughts and is scared that he might end his life but no one can tell he feels this way.Trevor asks himself and the listener if there isn’t anything left to eat in the world, would the work still consist of things worth living for.The brother just seems to be trying enjoy his time at the wedding and isn’t aware of the mistake of the marriage.The bridegroom seems to be the narrator and he was trying to enjoy his wedding, but then his father reveals that the married couple will not succeed with this marriage. The narrator agrees with this.It was just a wedding fueled with alcohol and immaturity.He hides his emotions from people and just becomes known for his outer shell that he calls a costume because it is not who he really is.He is comatose, in a deep unconsciousness, in his bedroom. The rose petals in the vacuum means he had set out rose petals for something romantic and had to clean them up because his romantic gesture failed.Who ever “you” may be, (it can be the groom but from the next line you can assume it means the bride) is looking through and scavenging in what I’m imagining as a room full of cobwebs. You’ll find nothing in there. So why are you looking? Fetching in the cobwebs is like this marriage. You’re not going to get anything out of it. You’ll just be covered in dirt and cobwebs. The dress is stained with wine continues to set the scene of this chaotic wedding.Trevor Powers feels that the people in his world are all immature and not ready for life and marriage.Flying critters, I’m assuming describes the drunk people in the ballroom. Brute, a savagely violent person or animal (according to Google) and flowers, representing the good people are all in their “finale bloom”.The groom, on his wedding day, stands smitten. “Smitten” in this case can mean that he was conquered by the barroom. The alcohol got the best of him. He lies fetal, like a baby, in earth’s womb, the Underworld, or the hell he is living in as a groom.Crazy people dance all dressed up, on the dance floor.Sirens are often associated with disasters, injury, destruction, death, accidents, etc, so this line is likely referring to the narrator experiencing one such event and being overwhelmed by the emotion that comes with being present for something warranting an emergency vehicle. The loud, obnoxious sirens that can leave a piercing feeling make him even more uncomfortable.Perhaps “bodies” refers to more extroverted personalities. The placing by the TV ties into this idea as often the people on television are friendly, outgoing people.Filling an entire wall up with posters is usually something people do when they are younger and they often reflect many of the interests in a persons life. Because of this Trevor feels that his life has been simplified down to what posters are on his wall. This could also be a reference to the walls of posters for shows you often see at smaller music venues or record stores. Seeing that Trevor was just starting out when he released this album and was in college at the time, he likely would have spent a lot of time in venues like this.He used to always want to be in the spotlight but as he started to grow up he became more reserved and the person he’s talking to in this song took that to mean he’s become a different person when really he’s become more himself.Trevor still isn’t 100% sure he knows what he wants to do with his life but feels like he’s closer to knowing now that he’s ever been.Little kids often make grand decisions about what the what to be when they grow up and then change them randomly. Every year Trevor found a new “calling” in life only to abandon it later, as he grew up he started to realize he needs to find out who he really is and what he wants to do.The singer wanted to become a lawyer when he was younger but Wasn’t willing to give what it takes.The person that the narrator is talking to is fundamentally a different person than he is. The other person will “make real friends quickly”, but the narrator is different: introspective, quiet. Making friends isn’t as easy for him.The change of word seems to be comparing sleep to death. This idea is explored a lot in twenty one pilots' music, too.This is the same line as before, with a twist. He is now alone, he lost his love, and therefor he doesn’t understand where the love has gone. It’s only something “they” talk bout.Here again he is talking about the way nobody really cares anymore, with the ironic statement that “everybody cares”.These lines are aimed towards self destruction. He hates himself. It may be that the first part of the intro is while he is in love, he is in a relationship, but the next part it’s over. And this makes it so he hates himself, and wants to die.I sounds like he has understood love, but he isn’t happy about it. “and this is what it is”This is more of an ironic statement that people don’t care. Everybody cares, but not really.He is talking about the transition from life to death, and by looking at the last line “I’m sure love exists, and this is what it is” it’s clear that he means that love will survive death it self.This is a commentary on how society condones individuality and change and everyone follows the same routine everyday. Everyone follows societal norms, or what everyone else is doing, and thus this makes them clones, essentially. This is a similar theme to that in “Again”. The theme reflected in this line also reminds me of the twenty one pilots song “March to the Sea”.Should be dyesThe narrator seems to have trouble sleeping, or insomnia. This line is similar to the famous quote “I’ll sleep when I’m dead”.Many times people with depression lash out at loved ones and are seen as acting selfish. This is actually the body trying to preserve itself, as it cannot focus on others while it itself is struggling to survive. The singer wonders whether the person who loves him now will still love him after they see how depression changes them, and possibly after the singer has hurt them as a result of depression. The singer is afraid that they will scare their lover away before the depression is over.Based on the singer’s past experience, this “sickness” is depression. For those suffering depression, the act of “curing it”, if possible, is not a single one day cure where you wake up and you’re free of depression, but a long process that is similar to climbing out of a deep hole. The best medical treatment for clinical depression is therapy and antidepressants. Antidepressants take many weeks to work, assuming it is the right type, so the road to getting rid of depression may take years, or even lifetimes.The speaker is not what everyone thinks he is.HuThe ego believes whatever reinforces it, regardless of truth.Powers continues to elaborate on how mankind lies to themselves.Everybody wants to think and believe they are great people, even when they aren’t.Man is hooked on believing that although they are putting destroying their bodies, and not treating themselves with respect or good health, that they are different. That they are not as mankind says, “what you eat”. The believe they are greater than that.Youth Lagoon’s debut album explored themes such as psychological dysphoria and mental distress that Powers had either seen or experienced. The narrator defends his odd tendencies by declaring that his love, unlike the loves that his partner might be experiencing with other guys, is long lasting and has been burning since Outkast dropped Hey Ya!. (That’s a long time).Although the song is primarily about Powers' ex-lover’s personality flaws, he makes sure not to overlook how content and regal he feels when they’re together; she must truly care about him to make such lofty promises about their future.A dissection of the phrase “forgive and forget”. Powers' pessimistic take is that while forgiveness is something that is not necessarily guaranteed after you fuck up, the dissolution of your representation in the minds of your former friends and lovers certainly is.Powers dissects his own neurotic behavior through the metaphor of the apple and the worm. Among other things, a sentient apple would worry about the insects that may feast on and inhabit it (c.f. James and the giant peach). In the metaphor, the insect is most likely his love interest, whose unpredictable behavior has the potential to destroy their relationshipEven though she’s much more intelligent and resourceful than the average person, Powers' lover often loses her rational ways when scared. Anger is sometimes a natural response to fear. It’s likely that Powers is making a reference to the phrase “blind with rage” to refer to his girlfriend’s volatile personality.Youth Lagoon’s Trevor Powers tell of the flaws that exist in his lover. The “season switchblade” may indicate that his lover is intensely and sporadically combative, starting fights at random and unpredictable moments. May also be a reference to Seasonal Affective Disorder.
